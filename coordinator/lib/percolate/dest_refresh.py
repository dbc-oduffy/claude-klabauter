"""Bring a publish destination's checkout level with its origin before a round
materializes anything into it.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every box in the fleet holds its own clone of the release
repo, and a percolate round writes the full published surface into that clone
and pushes it. A clone that is behind origin therefore does not merely miss a
peer's work -- it *reverts* it: the round syncs this box's idea of the whole
surface over the top, commits the difference as a deletion/rollback, and pushes
that as the new tip. Two boxes percolating in sequence, neither pulling, is a
ratchet that runs backwards. Refreshing first is what makes a round's commit a
delta against the fleet's tip rather than against this box's memory of it.

PM ruling 2026-09-02, in-session: the refresh is unconditional and blocking --
"the target release repo must be fully updated with origin/main before the
system starts, even if this means a few seconds delay" -- and it covers the
landing branch as well as `main`: "candidate branch of course on the local box
should be updated from origin before percolate and publish too, not just main,
as we land into candidate." The network round trip is a named exception to the
500ms brightline on that ruling, and belongs to the same class as
`push.outstanding.network`: its cost is the remote, not local work.

FAIL-CLOSED, AND ASYMMETRICALLY SO. A refresh that cannot be completed leaves
exactly the staleness this step exists to prevent, so a failure on the LANDING
branch (the checked-out one) refuses the round rather than proceeding on a
best-effort basis. `main` is warned about instead: it is not what a round lands
into, so a local `main` that cannot fast-forward cannot make this round
overwrite a peer -- it is a repo-hygiene fact worth printing, not a reason to
block a publish.

WHAT "LEVEL WITH ORIGIN" MEANS FOR A BRANCH WITH NO UPSTREAM. It means level
with the remote's DEFAULT branch, not a refusal. A tracking ref is how the
comparison is USUALLY made, never the thing being protected -- what is protected
is that this clone's base is not behind the tip a peer landed on, and a branch
with no upstream has a base like any other. A fresh clone on a fresh local
branch is the ordinary cloud shape, so refusing it made the normal case the
broken one. `default_remote_branch` resolves the base; only a clone that can
name no remote branch at all is refused, and detached HEAD still is (there is no
landing branch to measure).

NEGATIVE SPEC. This module never forces, resets, rebases, or discards: every
update here is fast-forward-only, with one exception narrow enough to name. A
landing branch that has diverged from its upstream is a human's call -- the
round refuses and says so, and no code path here can turn a divergence into a
silent overwrite. The one sanctioned abort outside a failed merge of our own is a
MERGE_HEAD whose message names this module's peer-merge of the upstream, left by
a killed round (`_recover_interrupted_op`); every other in-progress operation
is refused untouched. There is deliberately no override flag; a caller that wants
to publish from a stale clone has to make the clone not stale.

THE ONE RECONCILED DIVERGENCE: A SUBSUMED PEER PUBLISH. Two boxes publish the
same mirror; when box B publishes from source X and box A later merges X into
its own source, A's clone diverges from origin by B's publish commit -- whose
bytes A's source already carries. Nothing human-shaped remains to decide, yet
the refusal stranded every A publish until someone hand-merged a mirror the
`bump-foreign-repo-write` guard forbids touching. So when EVERY upstream-only
commit stamps a `[source-head <sha>]` that is an ancestor of the ref the round
publishes (`source_ref`, the `--source-ref` pin; HEAD when unpinned), the
branch records upstream as a parent with our tree kept (`merge -s ours`); the round then republishes the whole surface from a source
that contains B's. One unstamped commit, or one stamp the source cannot place
in its history, keeps the refusal.
